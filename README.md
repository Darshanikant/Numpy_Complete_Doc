## What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to perform operations on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is the foundation for many data science and machine learning libraries, making it an essential tool for data analysis and scientific computing.

## Why Use NumPy in Our Project?
- **Efficient Computations**: NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Provides built-in functions for complex mathematical operations, such as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and statistical computations.
- **Data Manipulation**: Enables easy handling and transformation of large datasets.
- **Broadcasting**: Allows element-wise operations without explicit loops, making code cleaner and faster.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and TensorFlow.

## Where is NumPy Used?
NumPy is widely used in various domains, including:
- **Data Science**: Handling large datasets, data preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Feature engineering and matrix operations.
- **Scientific Computing**: Physics, chemistry, and engineering simulations.
- **Finance**: Risk analysis and time series forecasting.
- **Image Processing**: Working with pixel data in image recognition tasks.
